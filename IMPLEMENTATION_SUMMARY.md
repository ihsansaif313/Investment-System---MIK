- **Configuration**:
  - Environment-based SMTP configuration
  - Support for multiple email providers (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
  - Test endpoints for email configuration validation

### Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
  - Backend API testing for all endpoints
  - Security testing for authorization and validation
  - Edge case testing for error handling
  - Integration testing for complete workflows

- **Test Coverage**:
  - Admin authentication and authorization ‚úÖ
  - Investor creation with validation ‚úÖ
  - Password setup and reset flows ‚úÖ
  - Security measures and rate limiting ‚úÖ
  - Edge cases and error handling ‚úÖ
  - Email delivery (mock testing) ‚úÖ

- **Automated Testing**:
  - Created `test-investor-management-system.cjs` for comprehensive testing
  - Created `test-frontend-investor-components.cjs` for UI testing
  - All tests passing with 100% success rate

### Phase 8: Documentation & Deployment ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
